# WheeLock: Enhancing Public Bicycle Security

This project was developed as part of the MA2079: Engineering Innovation and Design course at Nanyang Technological University. It secured the 3rd position in NTU's Engineering Innovation and Design Competition.

## Project Overview

WheeLock is an innovative solution aimed at addressing the increasing need for secure and convenient public bicycle parking in Singapore. With the rise in cycling as a mode of transportation, the challenges of bicycle theft and inadequate parking facilities have become more prominent. WheeLock offers a smart, automated bicycle locking system that enhances the security and usability of existing bicycle racks.

## My Contribution and Takeaways

I played a pivotal role in both the business development and the design of the final product. My contributions included developing a robust business plan for a B2B model, targeting public transportation operators and commercial property developers. Through this project, I was able to significantly improve my problem-solving skills and apply my engineering knowledge to devise scalable solutions—skills that I remain passionately committed to honing.

Additionally, I thoroughly enjoyed the business development aspect of the project, as it provided me with a deep understanding of how technology can be scaled for widespread utility and the nuances of pitching products effectively. These experiences have been invaluable in shaping my approach to integrating engineering with business strategy.

## Key Achievements

- **3rd Place**: Secured 3rd position in NTU's Engineering Innovation and Design Competition.
- **B2B Business Model**: Developed a comprehensive business plan focused on enhancing public bicycle security.
- **Innovative Design**: Contributed to the design of the WheeLock system, ensuring it meets the needs of both the public and potential corporate clients.

## Problem Statement

With Singapore's push towards a car-lite society and the increasing number of cyclists, there is a growing need for secure and convenient bicycle parking. Traditional bicycle locks are often insufficient, leading to concerns over theft and haphazard parking that obstructs public spaces.

## Our Solution

WheeLock is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing bicycle racks, providing an adjustable locking arm that can be secured with a temporary PIN. The system includes an alarm that triggers if tampering is detected, offering cyclists peace of mind.

### Unique Selling Proposition

- **Easy to Use**: The "LockNGo" feature allows cyclists to secure their bicycles in just 15 seconds.
- **Enhanced Security**: Alarm systems and tamper detection ensure the safety of bicycles.
- **Cost-Effective**: Designed to be an add-on to existing infrastructure, reducing the need for expensive new installations.

## Business Plan

The business plan focuses on a B2B model, targeting entities like the Land Transport Authority (LTA), commercial property developers, and public transportation operators. The goal is to integrate WheeLock into high-traffic areas to provide cyclists with secure parking options, thereby increasing foot traffic to these locations.

### Market Potential

The market for smart bicycle locking systems is still relatively untapped, especially in the ASEAN region. With the increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation, WheeLock is positioned to become a leader in this emerging market.

## Conclusion

WheeLock addresses a critical need in urban infrastructure, providing a secure and user-friendly solution for public bicycle parking. Our innovation not only improves security but also encourages more people to adopt cycling as a mode of transportation, contributing to Singapore's car-lite vision.
